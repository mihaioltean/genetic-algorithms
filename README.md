# Genetic algorithms for solving various difficult problems, implemented in C++

## What is inside:

### Single objective optimization
- ga_real_func_opt.cpp - Genetic algorithm with real encoding for solving function optimization problems.
- ga_binary_func_opt.cpp - Genetic algorithm with binary encoding for solving function optimization problems.

### Multi objective optimization

ga_binary_multi_criteria_opt.cpp - Genetic algorithm with binary encoding for multi-objective optimization problems. Must add "lista_voidp.cpp" to the project because I store the nondominated individuals in a list.
